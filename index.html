                Darth Vader and the Yellow Duck
                A Fairy Tale

            <content>
            <p>
            
                Once upon a time there was a smart boy called Darth Vader. He was on the way to see his Enemy Obi-Wan Kenobi Kenobi, when he decided to take a short cut through Hyde Park.
                
                It wasn't long before Darth got lost. He looked around, but all he could see were trees. Nervously, he felt into his bag for his favourite toy, Mr Teddy, but Mr Teddy was nowhere to be found! Darth began to panic. He felt sure he had packed Mr Teddy. To make matters worse, he was starting to feel hungry.
                
                Unexpectedly, he saw a yellow duck dressed in a yellow top hat disappearing into the trees.
                
                "How odd!" thought Darth.
                
                For the want of anything better to do, he decided to follow the peculiarly dressed duck. Perhaps it could tell him the way out of the forest.
                
                Eventually, Darth reached a clearing. In the clearing were two houses, one made from pods of peas and one made from macarons.
                
                Darth could feel his tummy rumbling. Looking at the houses did nothing to ease his hunger.
                
                "Hello!" he called. "Is anybody there?"
                
                Nobody replied.
                
                Darth looked at the roof on the closest house and wondered if it would be rude to eat somebody else's chimney. Obviously it would be impolite to eat a whole house, but perhaps it would be considered acceptable to nibble the odd fixture or lick the odd fitting, in a time of need.
                
                A cackle broke through the air, giving Darth a fright. A witch jumped into the space in front of the houses. She was carrying a cage. In that cage was Mr Teddy!
                
                "Mr Teddy!" shouted Darth. He turned to the witch. "That's my toy!"
                
                The witch just shrugged.
                
                "Give Mr Teddy back!" cried Darth.
                
                "Not on your nelly!" said the witch.
                
                "At least let Mr Teddy out of that cage!"
                
                Before she could reply, the yellow duck in the yellow top hat rushed in from a footpath on the other side of the cleaning.
                
                "Hello Big Duck," said the witch.
                
                "Good morning." The duck noticed Mr Teddy. "Who is this?"
                
                "That's Mr Teddy," explained the witch.
                
                "Ooh! Mr Teddy would look lovely in my house. Give it to me!" demanded the duck.
                
                The witch shook her head. "Mr Teddy is staying with me."
                
                "Um... Excuse me..." Darth interrupted. "Mr Teddy lives with me! And not in a cage!"
                
                Big Duck ignored him. "Is there nothing you'll trade?" he asked the witch.
                
                The witch thought for a moment, then said, "I do like to be entertained. I'll release him to anybody who can eat a whole front door."
                
                Big Duck looked at the house made from macarons and said, "No problem, I could eat an entire house made from macarons if I wanted to."
                
                "There's no need to show off," said the witch. Just eat one front door and I'll let you have Mr Teddy."
                
                Darth watched, feeling very worried. He didn't want the witch to give Mr Teddy to Big Duck. He didn't think Mr Teddy would like living with a yellow duck, away from his house and all his other toys.
                
                Big Duck put on his bib and withdraw a knife and fork from his pocket.
                
                "I'll eat this whole house," said Big Duck. "Just you watch!"
                
                Big Duck pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from macarons. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
                
                   And more.
                
                      And more.
                
                Eventually, Big Duck started to get bigger - just a little bit bigger at first. But after a few more fork-fulls of macarons, he grew to the size of a large snowball - and he was every bit as round.
                
                "Erm... I don't feel too good," said Big Duck.
                
                Suddenly, he started to roll. He'd grown so round that he could no longer balance!
                
                "Help!" he cried, as he rolled off down a slope into the forest.
                
                Big Duck never finished eating the front door made from macarons and Mr Teddy remained trapped in the witch's cage.
                
                "That's it," said the witch. "I win. I get to keep Mr Teddy."
                
                "Not so fast," said Darth. "There is still one front door to go. The front door of the house made from pods of peas. And I haven't had a turn yet.
                
                "I don't have to give you a turn!" laughed the witch. "My game. My rules."
                
                The woodcutter's voice carried through the forest. "I think you should give him a chance. It's only fair."
                
                "Fine," said the witch. "But you saw what happened to the duck. He won't last long."
                
                "I'll be right back," said Darth.
                
                "What?" said the witch. "Where's your sense of impatience? I thought you wanted Mr Teddy back."
                
                Darth ignored the witch and gathered a hefty pile of sticks. He came back to the clearing and started a small camp fire. Carefully, he broke off a piece of the door of the house made from pods of peas and toasted it over the fire. Once it had cooked and cooled just a little, he took a bite. He quickly devoured the whole piece.
                
                Darth sat down on a nearby log.
                
                "You fail!" cackled the witch. "You were supposed to eat the whole door."
                
                "I haven't finished," explained Darth. "I am just waiting for my food to go down."
                
                When Darth's food had digested, he broke off another piece of the door made from pods of peas. Once more, he toasted his food over the fire and waited for it to cool just a little. He ate it at a leisurely pace then waited for it to digest.
                
                Eventually, after several sittings, Darth was down to the final piece of the door made from pods of peas. Carefully, he toasted it and allowed it to cool just a little. He finished his final course. Darth had eaten the entire front door of the house made from pods of peas.
                
                The witch stamped her foot angrily. "You must have tricked me!" she said. "I don't reward cheating!"
                
                "I don't think so!" said a voice. It was the woodcutter. He walked back into the clearing, carrying his axe. "This little boy won fair and square. Now hand over Mr Teddy or I will chop your broomstick in half."
                
                The witch looked horrified. She grabbed her broomstick and placed it behind her. Then, huffing, she opened the door of the cage.
                
                Darth hurried over and grabbed Mr Teddy, checking that his favourite toy was all right. Fortunately, Mr Teddy was unharmed.
                
                Darth thanked the woodcutter, grabbed a quick souvenir, and hurried on to meet Obi-Wan Kenobi. It was starting to get dark.
                
                When Darth got to Obi-Wan Kenobi's house, his Enemy threw his arms around him.
                
                "I was so worried!" cried Obi-Wan Kenobi. "You are very late."
                
                As Darth described his day, he could tell that Obi-Wan Kenobi didn't believe him. So he grabbed a napkin from his pocket.
                
                "What's that?" asked Obi-Wan Kenobi.
                
                Darth unwrapped a doorknob made from macarons. "Pudding!" he said.
                
                Obi-Wan Kenobi almost fell off his chair.
                
                The End
